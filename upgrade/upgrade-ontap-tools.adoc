Upgrade is supported for both HA and non-HA deployments.

[NOTE]
To upgrade from ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.0 to 10.2 release, you need to first upgrade to ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.1 and then to 10.2 release.

// content changed for 10.2 release

*Before you begin*

If you're upgrading from ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere 10.0 to 10.1, you need to complete the following steps before proceeding with the upgrade task:

*Enable Diagnostics*

. From vCenter Server, open a console to ONTAP tools.
. Log in as the maintenance user.
. Enter *4* to select Support and Diagnostics.
. Enter *2* to select Enable remote diagnostic access.
//10.2 change
. Enter *y* to set the password of your choice.
. Login to VM IP address from the terminal/putty with user as 'diag' and password that was set in the previous step.

*Take Backup of MongoDB*

Run the following commands to take a backup of mongoDB:

* kn exec -it ntv-mongodb-0 sh - kn is an alias of kubectl -n ntv-system.
* env | grep MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD - run this command inside the pod.
* 'exit' - run this to come out of the pod.
* kn exec ntv-mongodb-0 --mongodump -u root -p MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD --archive=/tmp/mongodb-backup.gz --gzip - run this command to replace MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD set from above command.
* kn cp ntv-mongodb-0:/tmp/mongodb-backup.gz ./mongodb-backup.gz - run this command to copy the mongodb backup created using above command from pod to host.

*Take the snapshot of all the volumes*

* Run 'kn get pvc' command and save the output of the command.
* Take snapshots of all the volumes one by one using one of the following methods:
** From CLI, run the command _volume snapshot create -vserver <vserver_name> -volume <volume_name> -snapshot <snapshot_name>_
** From ONTAP system manager user interface search the volume by its name in the search bar then open that volume by clicking on the name. Go to snapshot and add the snapshot of that volume.

*Take the snapshot of ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere VMs in vCenter (3VMs in case of HA Deployment, 1 VM in case of non-HA deployment)*

* In the vSphere client user interface, select the VM.
* Go to the snapshots tab and click the *Take Snapshot* button.
