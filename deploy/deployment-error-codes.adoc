You might encounter error codes during ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere deployment, reboot, and recovery operations. 
The error codes are five digits long, where the first two digits represent the script that encountered the issue, and the last three digits represent the specific workflow within that script.

All error logs are recorded in the ansible-perl-errors.log file to facilitate easy tracking and resolution of issues. This log file contains the error code and the failed Ansible task. 
[NOTE]
The error codes provided on this page are for reference only. Contact the support team if error persists or if there's no resolution mentioned.

The following table lists the error codes and the corresponding file names.

|===

|*Error code*| *Script name*
|00 |firstboot-network-config.pl, mode deploy
|01 |firstboot-network-config.pl, mode upgrade
|02 |firstboot-inputs-validation.pl
|03 |firstboot-deploy-otv-ng.pl, deploy, ha
|04 |firstboot-deploy-otv-ng.pl, deploy, non-ha
|05 |firstboot-deploy-otv-ng.pl, reboot
|06 |firstboot-deploy-otv-ng.pl, upgrade, ha

The last three digits of the error code indicate the specific workflow error within the script:

|057 |Trident deployment has failed |*Ensure Management LIF and Data LIF IP addresses are reachable from VM. 

*Ensure NFS or iSCSI protocol is enabled and configured properly on ONTAP.

*Ensure that the NFS/iSCSI Data LIF IP address provided is correct and online.
