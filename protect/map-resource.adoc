You should map your resources on the protected site and recovery site so that virtual machines are configured to fail over into one group of hosts or the other.

*What you will need*

You should have connected the protected and recovery sites.

NOTE: In VMware Live Site Recovery, resources can be resource pools, ESXi hosts, or vSphere clusters.

*Steps*

. Log in to vCenter Server and click on *Site Recovery* > *Sites*.
. Select your protected site and click *Manage*.
. In the Manage tab, select *Resource Mappings*.
. Click *New* to create a new resource mapping.
+
The Create Resource Mapping wizard appears.

. In the Create Resource Mapping wizard, perform the following:
 .. Select *Automatically Prepare Mappings for Resource with Matching Names* and click *Next*.
 .. Select the required data center objects for the protected and recovery sites and click *Add Mappings*.
 .. Click *Next* after mappings are created successfully.
 .. Select the object used earlier to create reverse mapping and then click *Finish*.

*Result*

The Resource Mappings page displays the protected site resources and the recovery site resources. You can follow the same steps for other networks in your environment.
